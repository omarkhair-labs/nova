# Architecture progress log

Update this table in every consolidation PR.

| Field | Current state |
|---|---|
| Current phase | Phase 2 — Messages consolidation |
| Active PR | Phase 2 PR 13 — move conversation details/search/media/mute asynchronous orchestration into `ConversationDetailsViewModel`/`ConversationDetailsUiState` |
| CI status | Pending for Phase 2 PR 13; PRs #95–#107 passed on Blacksmith |
| Completed ownership changes | Phase 1 shell ownership; Phase 2 domain/repository/inbox/conversation owners; list/rows/composer ownership; #106 established stable conversation-tools data ownership; #107 switched the live V9 consumer to `AppContainer`; PR 13 moves details tab/query/media/context/mute state and coroutines behind a lifecycle-aware owner |
| Deleted legacy/versioned files | `NovaPrimaryHost.kt`; global `NovaPrimaryNavigationDispatcher.kt`; historical `NovaMessagingV9ToolsRepository.kt` implementation; `ConversationToolsCompatibility.kt` |
| Automated verification | PRs #106 and #107 passed full hosted backend + Android gates. PR 13 adds JVM characterization for 200-character search/debounce, blank-query clearing, context state, mute/session behavior, media loading, and the current key-based active-filter/load-more behavior; hosted CI must be green before merge |
| Remaining physical Samsung checks | Entire manual checklist in `SAMSUNG_SMOKE_CHECKLIST.md`; authorized Samsung SM-A266B detected previously, but non-destructive test install is blocked by its differently signed existing Nova package |
| Exact next PR | Phase 2 PR 14 — extract the details/search/media/context rendering and media-player UI out of `ConversationScreenV9` into stable, callback-driven Messages details UI without changing the new state owner |

## Phase 0 discovered risks

- root policy/dispatcher have JVM tests, but notification routing is private to
  `MainActivity` and has no pure parser seam;
- terminal 401/session expiry is repeated across many screens and repositories;
- conversation details UI still carries historical V9 naming/rendering and media-player platform state; PR 13 removes data/coroutine orchestration from it, then PR 14 extracts stable rendering;
- outer `ConversationScreen` and V8 composer both applied IME-related padding (resolved by #105: composer is the sole owner);
- instrumented/device tests are not run by the current hosted CI; and
- the physical Samsung smoke matrix remains incomplete because the available device has a differently signed installed Nova package.
