# Architecture progress log

Update this table in every consolidation PR.

| Field | Current state |
|---|---|
| Current phase | Phase 2 — Messages consolidation |
| Active PR | Phase 2 PR 23 — collapse `ConversationScreen -> V9 -> V8` into stable `ConversationScreen` + `conversation/ConversationContent` ownership and delete both historical screen files |
| CI status | Pending for Phase 2 PR 23; PRs #95–#117 passed on Blacksmith |
| Completed ownership changes | Phase 1 shell ownership; Phase 2 domain/repository/inbox/conversation owners; list/rows/composer; stable details/appearance/groups/new-message; PR 23 removes the final live versioned conversation-screen layer while preserving the same message/header/composer/details composition |
| Deleted legacy/versioned files | `NovaPrimaryHost.kt`; global `NovaPrimaryNavigationDispatcher.kt`; historical V9 tools/details helpers; temporary preference/group repository aliases; PR 23 deletes live `ConversationScreenV8.kt` and `ConversationScreenV9.kt` and renames their live body/header helpers under stable ownership |
| Automated verification | #117 passed full hosted backend + Android gates with new-message JVM characterization. PR 23 is a structural screen-owner move that preserves the exact header/message/composer/delete/photo/details/call-overlay behavior and must pass full hosted Django + Android JVM/lint/debug/release/AAB gates before merge; hosted CI does not execute instrumented/device tests |
| Remaining physical Samsung checks | Entire manual checklist in `SAMSUNG_SMOKE_CHECKLIST.md`; authorized Samsung SM-A266B detected previously, but non-destructive test install is blocked by its differently signed existing Nova package |
| Exact next PR | Phase 2 final enforcement/cleanup — remove any now-unused group model compatibility aliases, verify no live V8/V9 names or direct repository construction remain in Messages, update ownership/docs, and close Phase 2 if full gates pass |

## Phase 0 discovered risks

- root policy/dispatcher have JVM tests, but notification routing is private to
  `MainActivity` and has no pure parser seam;
- terminal 401/session expiry is repeated across feature state owners and remains a later cross-feature consolidation item;
- live V8/V9 screen layering is removed by PR 23; final enforcement must verify no versioned Messages ownership remains;
- outer `ConversationScreen` and V8 composer both applied IME-related padding (resolved by #105: composer is the sole owner);
- instrumented/device tests are not run by the current hosted CI; and
- the physical Samsung smoke matrix remains incomplete because the available device has a differently signed installed Nova package.
